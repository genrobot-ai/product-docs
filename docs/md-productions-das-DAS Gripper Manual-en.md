## 4. Quick Start Guide for Data Collection Specialist

### Step 1: Unboxing Inspection

1. Open the packaging box and take out all components
2. Assemble the gripper head.![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0777/8874/1847/files/AssembleGripperHead.jpg?v=1763551432)
   - Universal Grippers: Suitable for most grasping tasks.
   - Tactile Grippers: Suitable for tasks requiring precise force control.
   - Soft Grippers: Provide enhanced conformity.
3. Insert microSD Card, press the power button once to start the device and the LED indicator will emit a green light. The current booting process may take longer than usual. We appreciate your patience and are prioritizing optimizations for subsequent updates. If the boot time exceeds 20 seconds, please contact technical support.
4. When using the SD card for the first time, it needs to be formatted: Pull down the screen -> Open Settings -> Find "Format Micro SD Card" -> Click "Confirm". The system will format the SD card. After formatting once, it can be used normally thereafter. If you need to clear the data, you can also use the formatting function.

### Step 2: Start Acquisition

1. Click the record button to start data acquisition
2. The recording timing appears on the screen
3. After holding the device still for two seconds, perform the task actions you want to acquire, press the trigger to control gripper
4. Click the record button again to stop data acquisition
5. The recording time disappears, and data is automatically saved to the microSD card

**Important Notes**

1. During data collection, avoid excessive tilt angles. Keep the device as level as possible and begin collection while facing an area with some texture.
2. When clicking the record button to stop collection, the data will be saved within 2 seconds at most after clicking the button.

### Step 3: Data Transmission

#### microSD Card Reading (Recommended)

1. **Power off** the device.
2. Press the microSD card gently, insert it into the card reader and connect the card reader to the computer![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0777/8874/1847/files/microSD_card_position.png?v=1763123203)
3. Load the **Matrix Studio** and import your data.
